**Privacy Policy for Twitter Crypt**

Effective Date: 3/25/2025  

**1. Introduction**  
Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy outlines how Twitter Crypt ("the Extension") handles your data to ensure your information remains secure and private.

---

**2. Information We Collect**  
Twitter Crypt is designed to prioritize your privacy. The Extension does not collect, store, or transmit any of your personal data, tweets, or encryption keys to any server or third party. All encryption and decryption processes occur locally in your browser.

**3. Data Handling and Storage**  
- **Encryption Keys:** Your encryption keys are securely stored in your browser's local storage. This ensures that your keys are never uploaded to external servers.  
- **Encrypted Tweets:** Encrypted messages are posted directly to Twitter as tweets. These messages are not transmitted or processed by any external service.  
- **Decryption Process:** Decrypting tweets requires selecting the correct key, which is also processed entirely within your browser.  

**4. Third-Party Services**  
Twitter Crypt does not integrate with, or send data to, any third-party services. The Extension operates independently within your browser environment.

**5. Security Measures**  
We implement the following security practices to protect your data:  
- **Local Encryption:** All encryption and decryption processes are performed locally in your browser, ensuring no data leaves your device.  
- **Key Protection:** Encryption keys are stored securely using your browser's local storage mechanisms.  

**6. Your Responsibilities**  
While Twitter Crypt enhances your privacy, maintaining security is a shared responsibility:  
- Keep your encryption keys confidential.  
- Only share your keys with trusted contacts using secure communication methods.  
- Be cautious when posting encrypted content publicly.

**7. Changes to This Policy**  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected on this page with an updated effective date. We encourage you to review this policy periodically.
